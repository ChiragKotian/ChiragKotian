Description:
I'm an electronics enthusiast, working with electronics since my childhood. I like building complex electronic circuits and interfacing with microcontrollers using which I have built many technical projects, especially IOT ones which went on to represent the institutes I was studying at the district level. I have immense experience using microcontrollers like Arduino, single-board computers like Raspberry PI and many shields and sensors based around them. Coding in C++ is also one of the skills in my bag. I have completed many specialisation courses on IOT through Coursera. I am also good at 3D CAD modelling and 3D printing. I also have a good experience working with MATLAB and Simulink.
